# O$P$

Introduction

We at Owe$Pay$ hope to make the tracking payments for ordering of food simple and integrable into Telegram group chats.

In the future, we also hope to create a system to simplify the process of tracking orders and payments in a cohesive app.

# Motivation 

Whenever youâ€™re out with your friends or ordering supper with your hallmates, splitting the bill afterwards can be a hassle. From keeping track of who has yet to pay you back to updating your debts, we can only wish for a system that streamlines this process and is easy and intuitive to use all while being fully customisable.

For us personally, whenever someone orders supper, we will create a list of names and item costs and ask them to pay and remove the names from the list.

This generally clutters the group chat and makes things extremely messy especially when they are multiple orders and people who have not paid for previous orders.

Having a system that integrates with Telegram, a common group messaging platform allows for much higher adoption among users.

Going further, We aim to have a fully fledged app that is able to scan menu entries in receipts that reduces the input of each item manually.

# User Stories

* As the person who usually helps to pay first for food when ordering in deliveries for my hostel mates, I wish I had a way to easily visualise who is in debt with me.

* As the person who mainly orders food for my hostel level mates, I want presets that accomodate for common additional fees such as Goods and Services Charge (GST) and service charge. 

* As a student who tags on to food orders, I want to have a system that keeps track of how much I still owe to people and the breakdown of the debt.

* As a person who goes out to eat with friends , I want a simple system to create new orders to be repaid and update the status of my debts. 

* As a person who eats out with friends, I want a system that tracks the food items bought without the need for manually inputting the data, which reduces inconvenience for me.
