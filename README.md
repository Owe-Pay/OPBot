# O$P$

Introduction

We at Owe$Pay$ hope to make the tracking payments for ordering of food simple and integrable into Telegram group chats.

In the future, we also hope to create a system to simplify the process of tracking orders and payments in a cohesive app.

# Motivation 

Whenever youâ€™re out with your friends or ordering supper with your hallmates, splitting the bill afterwards can be a hassle. From keeping track of who has yet to pay you back to updating your debts, we can only wish for a system that streamlines this process and is easy and intuitive to use all while being fully customisable.

For us personally, whenever someone orders supper, we will create a list of names and item costs and ask them to pay and remove the names from the list.

This generally clutters the group chat and makes things extremely messy especially when they are multiple orders and people who have not paid for previous orders.

Having a system that integrates with Telegram, a common group messaging platform allows for much higher adoption among users.

Going further, We aim to have a fully fledged app that is able to scan menu entries in receipts that reduces the input of each item manually.
